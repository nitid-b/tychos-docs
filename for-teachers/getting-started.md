# Getting Started

The following resources have been created to help you use Tychos as a teaching tool. We have provided some example lessons, as well as video guides in order to give a jump-start. We have also provided some documentation on writing goals in Tychos as well as how to successfully install Tychos as an LTI tool into the [Instructure Canvas LMS](https://www.instructure.com/).
