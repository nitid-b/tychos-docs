# Lesson 6: Modeling The Momentum Principle

Students finally get to see how a force can be modeled in Tychos and how the change in a particle's state can be calculated using the momentum principle.

* Students will learn how to define a mass attribute for a particle.
* Students will learn how to calculate a change in momentum due to an applied force.
* Students will learn how to update a particle's velocity based on a change in momentum caused by the force.
