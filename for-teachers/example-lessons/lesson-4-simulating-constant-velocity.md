# Lesson 4: Simulating Constant Velocity

In this lesson, students will put together what they have learned in the previous lessons and begin simulating motion.

* Students will learn how to give a Particle object a velocity.
* Students will learn how to update the position of a particle based on its velocity.
* Students will learn how to use the function `drawArrow()` to represent velocity vectors.
