# Lesson 3: Simulating Change

Now that students know the basics of writing code in Tychos, its time to learn about coding repetitive calculations - what is known as iterative calculations. This is essential before moving on to simulating motion.

* Students will learn how change the value of a variable each frame.
* Students will learn how to use the built in varaibles of `t` and `dt` to represent time.
* Students will learn how to scale their calculations from frame rate time in Tychos to seconds using `dt`.
