# Lesson 9: Simulating Energy Transfer

Tychos has the ability to evaluate a condition based on a comparison between two values. This can be used to activate or deactivate a force given a specific condition. In this lesson students will learn about conditional statements and how they can be used to simulate a force that conditionally acts on an object.

* Students will learn how to define a conditional statement and use it to modify a varaible's value conditionally.
* Students will learn how to model a force that acts on a particle during an interval of time.
* Students will learn how to model a force that acts on a particle based on the position of the object.
