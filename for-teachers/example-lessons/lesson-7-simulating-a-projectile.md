# Lesson 7: Simulating A Projectile

In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the momentum principle. They will now learn how to model a particle tht is experiencing only a vertical gravitational force, and how a particle's vertical velocity will change while its horizontal velocity remains constant.

* Students will learn how to define a gravitational force acting on a particle.
* Students will learn how to model a projectile, and analyze its behavior.
