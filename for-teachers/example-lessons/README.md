# Example Lessons

We have designed some lessons that you can use to get started using Tychos in your classroom quickly. Designed and tested in an actual real high school classroom, we are confident that these lessons will really help get you rolling with Tychos. We encourage that you start here, but we also encourage that you take and modify the lessons as you see fit. We are always looking for feedback as well, so please contact us with how you are using Tychos in your own classroom.
