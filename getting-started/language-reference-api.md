## Comments

Comments are identified by a `#` symbol. Any characters after the `#` are not read by the Tychos interpreter. Here is an example of a comment:

```text
# This is a comment.
```

## Variables

A variable is a symbol that holds data. Variables in Tychos can store numerical data, text data, arrays, matrices, and objects. There is no need to use any kind of variable declaration syntax. To assign a variable a value, you just need an `=` character:

```text
x = 3
y = x
m = [10, 10]
```

## Matrices
