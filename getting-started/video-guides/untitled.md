# Tutorial 5: Graphs

Graphing is an incredibly powerful way to analyze the behavior of your simulation and one of the great tools offered as part of the application is the ability to easily plot points on a graph \(or graphs!\) With just a couple of lines of code, you can easily generate a motion graph, or really any graph for your simulation.
